#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE Product='iPhone'
    AND length(orderid) = 6 
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
  
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales

 SELECT product, price FROM JanSales 
    ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;
    
#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue FROM JanSales
    GROUP BY product;
    
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue FROM FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) FROM FebSales
    LEFT JOIN customers
    ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
    WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in February and include how many of each were sold.

    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
    
#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(customers.acctnum) FROM FebSales
    LEFT JOIN customers
    ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price) as 'total revenue' FROM JanSales
